iii. Composite transformations.
Let R be a rectangular window whose lower left corner is at L (-3,1) and upper right-hand corner is at R(2,6). If the line segment is defined with two end points with A (-4,2) and B (-1,7).
(a) The region codes of the two end points,
(b) Its clipping catezory and
(c) Stages in the clipping operations using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm.
Distinguish between boundary representation and space-partitioning representation of solid object representation schemes.
(b) List and describe the polygon tables representation for polygon surfaces of a 3-D object. 
Give an example.
Given a unit cube with one corner at (0, 0, 0) and the opposite corner at (1, 1,1), derive the transformations necessary to rotate the cube by ? degrees about the main diagonal (from (0, 0, 0) to (1, 1, 1) in the counter clock-wise direction when looking along the diagonal toward the origin.
