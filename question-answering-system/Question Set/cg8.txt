What are the steps involved in Bresenham’s line drawing algorithm for |m| > 1, where m is slope of the line.
Generate all raster points on the line segments, if the two end-points are given as (10,20) and (18,30) using the above algorithm.
Prove that a uniform scaling and a rotation form a commutative pair of operations, but that, in general, scaling and rotation are not commutative.
Derive the transformation matrix for rotation about origin.
List the algorithms which are suitable for line clipping when the clipping polygon is non-rectangular window.
Explain about the following categories of lines with respect to rectangular clipping window. 
i. Completely visible
ii. Clipping-candidate
iii. Completely invisible.
Explain the steps involved in curve generation by Bazier’s method.
Draw the Bernstein polynomials. Illustrate their role in Bazier curve generation.
What is the procedure for reflecting an about an arbitrarily selected plane.
What are the characterstics of perspective projections?
Distinguish between object-space and image space methods of visible surface detection algorithms. Give examples for each.
Given points P (1, 2, 0), P (3, 6, 20) P (2, 4, 6) and a view point C (0, 0, -10),
determine which points obscure the others when viewed from C.
