Discuss about the applications of computer graphics in the area of image processing.
Explain the steps involved in scan-line polygon-fill algorithm. 
Illustrate with an example polygon and the corresponding sorted edge table.
Explain the steps involved in 
i. odd-even rule and
ii. non-zero winding number rule, which are used for and carrying out inside-outside test.
Perform a 450 rotation of a triangle A(0,0), B(1,1) and C(5,2) about P(-1,-1).
Magnify the triangle with vertices A(0,0), B(1,1) and C(5,2) to thrice its size while keeping B(1,1) fixed.
Express window-to-viewport mapping in the form of a composite transformation matrix.
Find the normalization transformation that maps a window whose lower left corner is at (1,1) and upper right corner is at (3,5) on to entire normalized device screen.
Distinguish between boundary representation and space-partitioning representation of solid object representation schemes.
List and describe the polygon tables representation for polygon surfaces of a 3-D object. Give an example.
How can scaling with respect to a point Po(xo, yo, zo) be defined in terms of scaling with respect to the origin.
Explain the step-wise procedure in aligning an arbitrary plane with one of the principal planes.
Write an algorithm to implement scan-line algorithm for displaying visible surfaces of a given polyhedron.
Explain how the coherence property is used to evaluate points along and between scan-lines.
Explain the procedure to simulate the linear, two-dimensional motion of a filled circle inside a given rectangular area. 
The circle is to be given an initial velocity and the circle is to rebound from the walls with the angle of reflection equal to the angle of incidence.
